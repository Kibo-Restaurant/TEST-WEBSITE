Importance of a lazy loading script in a structure where different script have differenet functionalities. My project has kibo.html, kibo full menu.html, kibo party.html, kibo wedding.html, Kibo birthday.html. I have the snippets folder with json files (menu-items.json, about.json, wedding .json, party.json, ) and one html section which is loaded dynamically by lec 26.js into the Kibo main.html below the carousel, js folder, css folder with one file with all the additional styles. The js folder has carousel.js,jsonFUllMenu.js, lazy loading.js, menu.js, party.js and weddin.js. These js folders will dynamically load json content into the respective html pages. HTML pages a linked through an indentical navbar on to for example, when you open Kibo main you can click on a link to kibo full menu and come back to home  through another home link in the navbar.  When using liveserver in vs code and open kibo main.html two scripts I observe two js scripts(carousel.js and lec 26.js, bootstrap files 5.0 files linked in the head tag and carousel images), home-snippet.html loaded by lec 26.js  in my network tab in devtools. Note that different json content will be loaded into the other html pages throught the separate js files. Jsons will have text high  quality big size images and short videos which will load once for examples the wedding.html link is clicked. How can I use lazy loading to optimize this page?How do I optimize my page through vanilla js and other methods?



Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for images and videos using vanilla JS to ensure that media is only loaded when needed, improving load times and user experience.
Optimization Techniques: Minify and combine files, use CDNs, optimize images and videos, and load scripts asynchronously to further enhance page performance.
This approach will help optimize the performance of your Kibo project, making it faster and more efficient for users.
